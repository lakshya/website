About The Lakshya Foundation
-------

The Lakshya Foundation is a registerd trust founded by the alumni of [NIT Warangal](http://www.nitw.ac.in/).  
Its main aim is to effect a positive change in society by bringing together the students, faculty and alumni  
of the institute. Since its inception on 7th June, 2008, it is striving hard to financially help students 
coming from poor financial backgrounds. Over the years, Lakshya has moved on from just providing scholarships.
Given below is a list of all the projects we have or are working on:

* [Lakshya Scholarships](http://www.thelakshyafoundation.org/scholarships) - Provide funding for students 
who are unable to pay for their education with an interest-free loan based model
* [Asthra](http://www.theasthra.org/) - Ensure transparency using the Right to Information Act by educating as well
as implementing it.
* [The Innovation Project](http://www.thelakshyafoundation.org/innovation) - Converting bright ideas into realities,
 without worrying about finances.
* [The Library Project](http://www.thelakshyafoundation.org/library) - Providing curriculum & non-curriculum books to students,
through book donations.
* [Ek Jodi Kapda](http://www.thelakshyafoundation.org/ekjodikapda) - A pilot project of donating a set of clothes for 
the 456 million Indians living below poverty line.
