<p> Motto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transforming lives through education.</p>
<p> Founded on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7th June, 2008.</p>
<p> Founded by: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Srihari Maneru, Anand Rajagopalan.</p>
<p> Mentored by: &nbsp; &nbsp; Prof.&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ramachandra Rao, Dr. Padma madam, Asst. Prof, NITW.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Inspired by many great visionaries like Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and Dr.  Jayaprakash Narayan , and coming face to face with a real problem in  which some students were in need of financial help to continue their  education, it was realized that 'Money should not be a hurdle for  education'. Funds were raised and the tution fees of the students were  paid. Thus, The Lakshya Foundation was formed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> The Lakshya Foundation initiated &lsquo;Project 1&rsquo; which would later be known  as &ldquo;Lakshya scholarships&rdquo; in which tuition fees are paid for students  from a poor financial background. It is ensured that the verification  is fool proof by personally visiting the applicant&rsquo;s residence. So far  Lakshya has fully funded 10 scholars through this initiative. In 2010,  Lakshya moved from a grants based model to a loan based model, for  sustainability and to reach out to many more students.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> Over the years, Lakshya transformed into a full fledged organization and started multiple projects like:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> 1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>ASTHRA</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Ensure transparency in NITW with RTI as a tool.</p>
<p> 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;The Innovation Project</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Converting bright ideas into realities, without worrying about the financial foe.</p>
<p> 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Library Project</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Providing non curriculum books to students, to gain a broader perspective.</p>
<p> 4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>EK JODI KAPDA</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; &lsquo;A SET OF CLOTHES&rsquo; for the 456 million Indians living below poverty line.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> With Transparency as the Mantra, and Hard work as the tool, Lakshya strives to &ldquo;Transform lives through Education&rdquo;.</p>
