<p> The Lakshya Foundation is a registerd trust founded by the alumni of NIT Warangal on 7th June, 2008.</p>
<p> Coming face to face with a real problem where some students were in need of financial help to continue their education, we realized that money should not be a hurdle for education. Funds were raised and the tution fees of the students were paid. Thus, the Lakshya Foundation was born.</p>
<p> The Lakshya Foundation initiated Lakshya scholarships. As part of this project, intitute fees (tuition fee + hostel fee) are paid for students coming from poor financial backgrounds. It is ensured that the verification is fool proof by personally visiting the applicant's residence. In 2010, Lakshya moved from a grants based model to a loan based model to endure sustainability and to reach out to many more students.</p>
<p> Over the years, Lakshya has moved on from just providing scholarships. Given below is a list of all the projects we have or are working on:</p>
<p> 1) <strong><a href="<?=url::base().'scholarships'?>">Lakshya Scholarships</a></strong> - Provide funding for students who are unable to pay for their education.</p>
<p> 2) <strong><a href="http://www.theasthra.org">Asthra</a></strong> - Ensure transparency using the Right to Information Act.</p>
<p> 3) <strong><a href="<?=url::base().'innovation'?>">The Innovation Project</a></strong> - Converting bright ideas into realities, without worrying about finances.</p>
<p> 4) <strong><a href="<?=url::base().'library'?>">The Library Project</a></strong> - Providing non curriculum books to students.</p>
<p> 5) <strong><a href="<?=url::base().'ekjodikapda'?>">Ek Jodi Kapda</a></strong> - A set of clothes for the 456 million Indians living below poverty line.</p>
<!--<p> With Transparency as the Mantra, and Hard work as the tool, Lakshya strives to &ldquo;Transform lives through Education&rdquo;.</p>-->
