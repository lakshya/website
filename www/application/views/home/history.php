<p>Under the banner of The Lakshya Foundation's maiden project, for the first time in NIT Warangal's history, the students, faculty and alumni worked together to start something new and helped it grow. Under this project, Lakshya funds students in need of financial assistance in NITW.</p>
<p>The idea was adopted based on the consensus from a survey conducted through various batches. Once finalized, our benevolent alumni helped Lakshya make this venture a success. Contributions came from many, spread over various batches. The batch of 2006, who made a large collective effort, wanted to dedicate this to two of their deceased batch mates and hence the first set of scholarships handed out was called the Appa Rao-Sharma Fund Scholarships.</p>

 <b>The Appa Rao-Sharma Fund</b>
<p>The batch of 2006, who made a large collective effort, wanted to dedicate this to two of their deceased batch mates and hence the first set of scholorships handed out was called the Appa Rao-Sharma Fund.</p>
<p>Even before the Trust was formed officially, a sort of survey was conducted to determine how feasible it would be to adopt this task. A word was passed on to all the batches regarding this and in the process, we received a few applications. We really did not have a mechanism in place to verify the applicant's claim or his or her economic status, unless we saw their living conditions ourselves.</p>
<p>The money was not difficult to come by, as the alumni (especially the batch of 2006) had heard of this and had begun collecting the required sum. It was this partnership that led to our first successful project. Two students were short listed and their tuition fee was paid with the money thus raised.</p><br/><br/>
<p>The Lakshya Foundation is proud to have funded seven scholars so far and we are determined to continue lending a helping hand to all those who need it at NITW in the years to come.</p>
<p>Your continued support and guidance will definitely help us lend a far-reaching hand.</p>
