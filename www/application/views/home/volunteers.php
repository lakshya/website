  <li>One of the mandatory steps is to verify the applcant's claims by visiting his or her home. </li>

<h2>Guidelines for the verifier:  </h2>
<ol>
  <li>Verify the points stated in student's application form against what you actually see at his/her home.</li>
  <li> Ask the applicant's parents/guardians the following:
    <ul>
      <li> How are they currently funding the student? </li>
      <li> How will they raise funds if the student does not get the scholarship? </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Assess if the scholarship is absolutely necessary for the student. Out of 26 applicants, we will be able to fund only two to three students.</li>
</ol>
