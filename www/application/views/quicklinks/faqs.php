<b>Q.1) Where does the funding come from?</b><br/>
<p>Ans: There is neither a single source nor is there any restriction from where we intend to raise funds. One strong option is our own batch-mates, another is the NITW alumni and we also intend informing everyone we know about the trust. Though we have started with NITW, we wish to move our activities to the general public too.</p><br/><br/>
<b>Q.2) Does a student funded under the 'Lakshya Scholarships' project have to repay the money?</b><br/>
<p>Ans: Yes. With effect from July2011, Lakshya Scholarships will be a loan based model. A student funded under this project will be required to repay the amount, free of interest, within 4 years of graduating. Time spent on hogher education will not b considered as part of the 4 year repayment time period.</p><br/><br/>
<b>Q.3) What is the need to support poor students from NITW when banks are ready to give loans?</b><br/>
<p>Ans: Though the government insists that interest free loans are available, we have seen for ourselves how these rules are followed. However, since we have a similar loan model, and since we cannot fund every student in need, we have started educating the students about their right to an interest free loan.</p><br/><br/>
