<b>Q.1) How much money will be needed ?</b><br/>
<p>Ans: The trust will look to pay the tuition fees and the mess bills for the Lakshya Scholar throughout his stay at NITW. This is a breakup of the fees we will have to cover per student depending on whether the student is currently in the first, second or third year.</p><br/><br/>
<b>Q.2) From where will the funding come ?</b><br/>
<p>Ans: Neither is there only one source nor any restriction from where we intend to raise funds. One strong option is our own batch-mates, another is the NITW alumni and we also intend informing our everyone we know about the trust. We wish to make it body that does good for society. Though we have started with NITW, we wish to move our activities to the general public too.</p><br/><br/>
<b>Q.3) How will the project be organised ?</b><br/>
<p>Ans: Step-1:Putting up posters in all the messes, canteens, department notice boards.
Step-2:Announcing in all the classes, regarding the trust's working and process of applying for the scholorship.
Step-3:Shorlisting based on the applications submitted.
Step-4:Verification of the shortlisted applicants by visiting their homes and talking to their family and friends.
Step-5:Finalizing the Lakshya Scholars.</p><br/><br/>
<b>Q.4) What is the need to support poor students from NITW when banks are ready to give loans?</b><br/>
<p>Ans: Yes, banks do give loans, but not everyone can afford it. Taking a loan is risky, especially when one's income is determined by the amount of rainfall in one of India's mosty drought affected regions, which is the case with some from the farming community. We wish to support those who are interested in pursuing their education but are living a hand to mouth existence to fulfill that dream.</p><br/><br/>
<b>Q.5) Does a Lakshya Scholor have to repay the trust in some way after graduating?</b><br/>
<p>Ans: A final decision has not yet been taken on this issue. We do not want to put any conditions while giving out the scholorships, but we want to ensure that the Lakshya Scholar inturn will be ready to help those in need when his/her time arrives.Please do mail us your view regarding this to info@thelakshyafoundation.org</p><br/><br/>
